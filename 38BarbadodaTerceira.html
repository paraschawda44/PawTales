        <h2>Barbado da Terceira</h2>
        <p>
            <p>The Barbado da Terceira is a medium to large working dog breed that originated on Terceira Island in the Azores, Portugal. This rare breed was traditionally used as a cattle-driving dog, helping farmers manage livestock across rough terrain and open fields. It is a strong and agile breed with a confident and hardworking nature.</p>

<p>Barbado da Terceira dogs are known for their long, shaggy, and curly coat that covers their entire body, including the face. Their fur can come in different colors such as fawn, brown, black, or gray, sometimes with white markings. The coat helps protect them from harsh weather conditions, but it also requires regular grooming to prevent matting.</p>

<p>In personality, the Barbado da Terceira is intelligent, loyal, and alert. They are very devoted to their family and often form strong bonds with their owners. This breed is naturally protective, making it a good watchdog, but it is also friendly and affectionate with people it knows well.</p>

<p>These dogs are highly energetic and need plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation. Daily walks, playtime, and training activities are important to keep them happy and prevent boredom. Because they are intelligent and eager to work, they excel in obedience training, agility, and other dog sports.</p>

<p>The Barbado da Terceira is best suited for active families or owners who can give them space and time to exercise. Regular grooming, training, and socialization are essential to keep them healthy and well-behaved. Overall, this breed is a loyal, hardworking, and energetic companion that thrives in an active and loving home.</p>
