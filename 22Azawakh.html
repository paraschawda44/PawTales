        <h2>Azawakh</h2>
        <p>
            <p>The Azawakh is a tall, elegant, and rare sighthound breed that originated in the Sahel region of Africa, especially in countries like Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. This breed was traditionally kept by nomadic tribes as a hunting dog and guardian, valued for its speed, endurance, and loyalty. The Azawakh was used to chase fast game such as gazelles across deserts and open plains.</p>

<p>Azawakh dogs have a very slim, tall, and athletic body with long legs and a deep chest. Their coat is short, fine, and smooth, coming in many colors such as fawn, red, brindle, blue, black, or white, often with white markings on the chest and feet. Their graceful posture and slender build give them a unique and noble appearance.</p>

<p>In terms of personality, the Azawakh is loyal, reserved, and independent. They form strong bonds with their families and are naturally protective, making them excellent guard dogs. While they can be affectionate with their owners, they are often cautious or aloof with strangers, which is a natural trait of the breed.</p>

<p>The Azawakh is intelligent but independent-minded, so training requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. Early socialization is very important to help them become confident and well-behaved dogs. They excel in activities such as lure coursing, running, and agility, where they can use their natural speed and athleticism.</p>

<p>Azawakh dogs are highly energetic and need plenty of daily exercise, including long walks, running, and outdoor play. They are best suited for active owners with space for them to run freely. Their short coat is easy to maintain with minimal grooming. Overall, the Azawakh is a loyal, elegant, and athletic companion that thrives in active homes with proper training, exercise, and care.</p>
