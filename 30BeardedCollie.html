        <h2>Bearded Collie</h2>
        <p>
            <p>The Bearded Collie is a medium-sized herding dog breed that originated in Scotland. Originally bred to herd sheep and cattle in the rough Scottish Highlands, this breed is known for its intelligence, agility, and strong work ethic. Bearded Collies have been valued for generations as reliable and energetic working dogs.</p>

<p>Bearded Collies have a long, flowing double coat that is soft, weather-resistant, and often slightly wavy. Their coat colors include black, blue, brown, or fawn, often with white markings on the face, chest, and feet. The breed’s expressive eyes and characteristic “beard” of long hair around the muzzle give it a friendly and distinctive appearance.</p>

<p>In terms of personality, Bearded Collies are lively, affectionate, and playful. They are highly social dogs that thrive on companionship and enjoy interacting with their families, including children. Bearded Collies are also alert and energetic, making them excellent watchdogs, though they are generally friendly and non-aggressive.</p>

<p>This breed is highly intelligent and trainable, responding best to positive reinforcement and gentle guidance. Bearded Collies excel in obedience, agility, herding, and dog sports. Early socialization and consistent training help them develop into well-mannered and confident dogs.</p>

<p>Bearded Collies are active dogs that require daily physical exercise and mental stimulation. Walks, playtime, and interactive activities are essential for their well-being. Their long coat requires regular grooming to prevent matting and tangling. Overall, the Bearded Collie is a loyal, energetic, and intelligent companion that thrives in active, loving homes where they receive attention, exercise, and care.</p>
