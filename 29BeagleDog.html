        <h2>Beagle Dog</h2>
        <p>
            <p>The Beagle is a small to medium-sized hound breed that originated in England. Originally bred for hunting small game such as rabbits and hare, Beagles have an exceptional sense of smell and strong tracking instincts. Their compact size, stamina, and friendly nature made them popular both as working dogs and family companions.</p>

<p>Beagles have a short, smooth coat that is typically tri-colored with shades of black, brown, and white, though some may have lemon or red markings. Their large, expressive eyes and long, floppy ears give them an adorable and approachable appearance. Beagles have a muscular and sturdy build, ideal for active work and play.</p>

<p>In personality, Beagles are curious, friendly, and energetic. They are highly social dogs that enjoy being around people and other pets. Beagles are affectionate with their families and are especially good with children, making them excellent companions for households with kids.</p>

<p>This breed is intelligent and trainable, but their strong hunting instincts can sometimes make them stubborn or easily distracted. Positive reinforcement and consistent training methods work best. Beagles excel in scent work, tracking, agility, and obedience when properly motivated.</p>

<p>Beagles are active dogs that require regular exercise such as daily walks, playtime, and outdoor activities to stay healthy and happy. Their short coat is easy to groom, though they do shed seasonally. Overall, the Beagle is a friendly, energetic, and intelligent companion that thrives in loving homes where they receive attention, activity, and social interaction.</p>
