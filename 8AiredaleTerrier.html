        <h2>Airedale Terrier</h2>
        <p>
The Airedale Terrier is a large terrier breed that originated in England, especially in the Aire Valley. It is often called the “King of Terriers” because it is the largest of all terrier breeds. Originally, Airedales were bred for hunting, guarding, and working with police and military due to their intelligence and courage.
</p>

<p>
Airedale Terriers have a strong, athletic body and a distinctive wiry coat that is usually tan with a black saddle. Their coat is dense and water-resistant, which helped them hunt in rivers and rough terrain. Regular grooming and trimming are needed to keep their coat healthy and neat.
</p>

<p>
In personality, Airedale Terriers are intelligent, energetic, and playful. They are very loyal to their family and can be protective, making them good watchdogs. They are also friendly and affectionate with their owners and enjoy being part of family activities.
</p>

<p>
Airedales are active dogs that need daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation. They love running, playing, and learning new tricks. Because they are smart but sometimes stubborn, early training and socialization are important. With proper care, exercise, and love, the Airedale Terrier becomes a loyal, fun, and confident companion dog.
