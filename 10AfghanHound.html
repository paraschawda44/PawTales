        <h2>Afghan Hound</h2>
        <p>
The Afghan Hound is a tall and elegant dog breed that originated in Afghanistan. It is one of the oldest dog breeds in the world and was originally bred for hunting fast prey in deserts and mountains. Afghan Hounds were prized by royal families and hunters because of their speed, agility, and sharp eyesight.
</p>

<p>
Afghan Hounds are famous for their long, silky, and flowing coat, which gives them a very royal and graceful look. Their coat can come in many colors such as cream, black, gold, silver, and brindle. Because of their long hair, they require regular grooming, brushing, and bathing to keep their coat clean and beautiful.
</p>

<p>
In personality, Afghan Hounds are independent, intelligent, and dignified. They are not always very obedient like some other breeds, but they are gentle and affectionate with their family. They can be reserved with strangers, but they are loyal and loving companions.
</p>

<p>
Afghan Hounds are active dogs that need daily exercise and space to run. They love running in open areas and playing, but they also enjoy relaxing at home. Early training and socialization are important to manage their independent nature. With proper care, grooming, and exercise, the Afghan Hound becomes a graceful, loyal, and beautiful companion dog.
